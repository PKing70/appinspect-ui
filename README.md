# Appinspect UI

This app is created by Ryan O'Connor and Steve McMaster.

It is built with [Nextron](https://github.com/saltyshiomix/nextron).

## Releases

Releases can be found on the right-hand side of this Github page. We package versions of this app for both Mac and Windows Operating Systems.

## Running the App

We provide an installer and standalone app.

### Mac OS

On Mac OS, our code is signed. However you may need to right click the app and then click open. This is a one time thing. Once you do this, your operating system will remember this and the app will never prompt you again.
